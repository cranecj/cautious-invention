# Technical Documentation for Game Collection

## Overview
This is a web-based game collection featuring four distinct games: Super Tic Tac Toe, Wordle, Flappy Square, and Aim Practice. Each game demonstrates different programming concepts and game development techniques.

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic and interactions
- **Canvas API**: 2D graphics rendering (Flappy Square, Aim Practice)
- **Local Storage API**: High score persistence
- **Web APIs**: Fullscreen, Confetti library (CDN)

### Code Organization

#### Super Tic Tac Toe (`script.js`)
**Key Components:**
- `superBoard`: 9x9 array representing the game state
- `smallBoardWins`: Tracks which small boards are won
- `aiMove()`: Simple random AI implementation
- `checkWin()`: Win condition logic for both small and super boards
- `highlightActiveBoard()`: Visual feedback system

**Algorithms:**
- Basic minimax could be implemented for better AI
- Win detection uses standard tic-tac-toe algorithms
- Board state management with nested arrays

#### Wordle (`wordle.js`)
**Key Components:**
- `currentWord`: Randomly selected from `targetWords` array
- `checkGuess()`: Letter matching and coloring logic
- `isValidWord()`: Dictionary validation against `words.js`
- `updateGrid()`: Visual feedback with color coding
- `createKeyboard()`: Dynamic on-screen keyboard

**Data Structures:**
- Large word dictionary (words.js) for validation
- Curated target word list for better gameplay
- Grid-based state management

#### Flappy Square (`flappy.js`)
**Key Components:**
- `bird` object: Position, velocity, physics properties
- `pipes[]` array: Obstacle management
- `coins[]` and `fireworks[]`: Collectible systems
- Physics simulation with gravity and collision detection
- Particle system for visual effects

**Game Systems:**
- Procedural pipe generation
- Collision detection (AABB and circle-based)
- Difficulty scaling system
- Local storage high score system

#### Aim Practice (`fps.js`)
**Key Components:**
- `Target` class: Position, rendering, hit detection
- Canvas-based rendering system
- Timer and scoring mechanisms
- Miss penalty system (-1 second per miss)
- Overlap prevention for target placement

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient collision detection using distance calculations
- Target pooling to prevent overlap
- Canvas optimization techniques

## Game Mechanics Analysis

### Super Tic Tac Toe Strategy
- **Board Selection**: Move placement determines opponent's next board
- **Strategic Depth**: Multiple layers of tic-tac-toe create complex decisions
- **AI Improvement**: Current AI is random; could implement minimax with alpha-beta pruning

### Wordle Implementation Details
- **Word Selection**: Curated list ensures playable words
- **Feedback System**: Three-state color coding (correct/wrong position/not present)
- **Input Validation**: Real-time dictionary checking
- **Cheat Codes**: Debug features for testing ('V' key, '4321' sequence)

### Flappy Square Physics
- **Gravity System**: Constant downward acceleration
- **Jump Mechanics**: Instant velocity change on input
- **Collision Types**: Rectangle-rectangle and circle-rectangle detection
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Speed multipliers based on score and selected difficulty

### Aim Practice Mechanics  
- **Target Generation**: Random positioning with overlap prevention
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Hit/miss ratio calculation
- **Time Pressure**: Miss penalties create urgency
- **Customization**: User-selectable parameters

## Performance Optimizations

### Canvas Rendering
```javascript
// Efficient clearing and redrawing
ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
// Batch draw operations
// Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
```

### Memory Management
- Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects (particles, targets)
- Efficient array operations (splice vs pop/push)
- Event listener cleanup when appropriate

### Local Storage
```javascript
// High score persistence
localStorage.setItem('flappyHighScore', highScore);
let highScore = localStorage.getItem('flappyHighScore') || 0;
```

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated (word checking, key input filtering)
- No eval() or dangerous DOM manipulation
- XSS prevention through proper text content handling

### Cheat Code Implementation
- Debug features are implemented safely
- No security-sensitive information exposed
- Educational/testing purposes only

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Consistent naming conventions (camelCase)
- Clear function separation
- Event-driven architecture
- Modular game state management

### Browser Compatibility
- ES6+ features used (const, let, arrow functions)
- Canvas API fallbacks where needed
- Cross-platform event handling

### Testing Considerations
- Manual testing for all game mechanics
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Performance testing for canvas games

## Potential Improvements

### Super Tic Tac Toe
- Implement minimax AI with difficulty levels
- Add animation for moves and wins
- Tournament mode for multiple games

### Wordle
- Daily word challenge mode
- Statistics tracking (games played, win percentage)
- Hard mode with additional constraints
- Multiplayer variant

### Flappy Square
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Background parallax scrolling
- Sound effects and music
- Achievement system

### Aim Practice
- Moving targets
- Different target sizes
- Leaderboard system
- Training scenarios

## Build and Deployment

### Requirements
- Modern web browser
- Local web server for development (optional but recommended)
- No build process required - pure client-side code

### File Dependencies
```
Wordle: words.js, targetwords.js, confetti library (CDN)
All others: Self-contained with shared styles.css
```

### Deployment Notes
- All games work as static files
- No server-side dependencies
- CDN dependency for confetti animation (wordle.html)
- Local storage requires HTTPS in production for some browsers

This documentation provides the technical foundation for understanding, maintaining, and extending the game collection.
